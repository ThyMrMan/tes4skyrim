"""Clean-room in-game test harness for converted quest / dialogue / script logic.

Test ANY quest. Nothing here is specific to one: the quest EDID is an argument,
and the whole cast -- speakers, their placed references, the stage list -- is
DISCOVERED from the export for whatever quest you name. There are no hardcoded
actor, variable or topic names anywhere in this file.

Full methodology: docs/commentary/ingame_testing.md

WHY A CLEAN ROOM
----------------
Observing a bug in a live playthrough is unreliable in a way that is easy to
miss: the quest keeps advancing while you measure, other scripts write the same
variables, AI packages drag actors out of the cell, and any variable you poke to
set up a test is immediately fought over by whatever else is running. A reading
taken that way is not evidence -- it is a snapshot of several interleaved
systems, and it will support almost any theory you bring to it (measured the
hard way, 2026-08-15: a 95-second "reproduction" was taken at stage 50 of a bug
that only exists at stage 42, with hand-written baton variables, and proved
nothing at all).

So: move to an EMPTY interior, bring exactly the actors under test, drive only
the thing being tested, and reset between runs.

    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py doctor
    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py cast    --quest Charactergen
    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py setup   --quest Charactergen
    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py reset   --quest Charactergen --stage 42
    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py run     --quest Charactergen --seconds 60 \\
        --dialogue --out temp/run1.log
    python tools/live/quest_labtest.py restore

`cast` needs no game -- it is a pure export read, so the cast can be worked out
before the game is even launched.

# agreed test cell -- do not "improve" on it.
#
# A previous session talked itself out of it: its child GRUP carries 14 REFR
# records, so it was declared a furnished dungeon and swapped for QASmoke. That
# reasoning was wrong in the way that matters. The refs are the room's own
# geometry -- it is a TEST room, so it HAS a floor and walls, which is the whole
# requirement. What a clean room must not contain is *other actors and other
# quests' scripts*, and AnvilMarkTest contains neither.
#
# QASmoke is the worse choice precisely because it is Skyrim's live QA cell: it
# is stuffed with vanilla test actors and containers that contribute their own
# GREETING/HELLO candidates to the very topic-selection machinery a dialogue
# test is measuring.
#
# 🛑 Verify a cell with `player.getincell <cell>`, never with coordinates. Two
# different cells here both report z~7239, so a position check "confirmed" a
# room the player had never left. `getincell` also distinguishes a cell that
# does not exist at all (WITestHold: "Item 'WITestHold' not found") from one
# the coc simply failed to reach -- a distinction coordinates cannot make.

    still standing at its spawn point in ImperialDungeon01, while stage 40's
    scene takes place in Room B (ImperialDungeon02). The actors only reach Room
    B by PLAYING stages 0..40, which a bare setstage skips -- so the harness was
    observing an empty room and calling it a result.

    Bethesda already solved this. Charactergen's stage 0 carries seven log
    entries that are pure staging presets, each captioned with the scene it sets
