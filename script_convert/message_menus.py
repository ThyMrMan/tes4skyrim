"""TES4 multi-button MessageBox → Skyrim MESG menu plan.

Oblivion scripts drive every in-world choice menu with

    MessageBox "Would you like a blessing?" "Yes" "No"
    ...
    set button to GetButtonPressed          ; polled from GameMode

Skyrim has no dynamic message boxes: buttons live on an authored MESG record
and `Message.Show()` parks its calling thread until the player clicks, then
returns the button index. So every button-carrying MessageBox call site needs
a MESG record in the output plugin, and the script needs the Show()/consume
idiom instead of the poll.

This module is the SHARED analysis both sides run so they agree exactly:

  * the importer (tes5_import.pipeline) builds the plan and writes one MESG
    per call site — EDID `TES4Msg_<Script>_<NN>`, DESC = the message text,
    ITXT per button — then registers each EDID in _WELL_KNOWN_PROPERTIES so
    the VMAD property pass can bind them;
  * the script pipeline (script_convert.pipeline) ships the plan to its
    workers, and the converter emits `TES4_MsgButton = TES4Msg_X_01.Show()`
    at the call site plus a consume-on-read helper for GetButtonPressed
    (TES4 semantics: the clicked index is returned once, then -1 again).

Sites are numbered in SOURCE order within each script, but the converter can
process blocks out of source order (MenuMode merges into the GameMode poll),
so it matches sites by (text, buttons) content and takes the next unused name
for that content — identical text twice in one script yields _01 then _02 in
either walk order.

A MessageBox with only its message string (no buttons) stays a
Debug.MessageBox, and a GetButtonPressed in a script that shows no button box
of its own (a handful poll a box some OTHER script showed — cross-script
GetButtonPressed was global state in TES4) keeps the old `-1` conversion:
those readers were dead before this plan existed and stay explicitly dead
rather than silently miswired.

FO3/FNV spell the same idiom as `ShowMessage <MESG>` against an AUTHORED MESG
record, polled by the same GetButtonPressed. Such a site enters the plan under
the MESG's own EDID with text None: the importer converts that record itself
and writes nothing for it, and the converter matches the site by name.

# equivalent: it parks the calling thread AND pauses gameplay until a button
# is clicked, restoring both the choice and the authored pacing.
