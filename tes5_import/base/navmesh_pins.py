"""Hand navmesh corrections that survive the generator: frozen patches and cuts.

A correction in `tests/navmesh_fixed/` is a snapshot keyed by triangle INDEX,
so it decays the moment the generator moves and it is gitignored.  The pin
file is the durable half of the same intent, stored as WORLD POSITIONS: a
frozen patch (`frozen` + `voids`) keeps a human's triangles verbatim, and a
cut removes floor inside a polygon and height band.  Both apply after the
build (`apply_hand_edits`), so neither depends on how the generator works.

    edits = hand_edits_for('Nehrim.esm', 'SchattenrufMinePart05')

This module lives OUTSIDE `tes5_import/navmesh/` on purpose: that folder's
