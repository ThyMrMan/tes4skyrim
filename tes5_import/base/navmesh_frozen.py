"""Frozen navmesh patches: triangles a human owns, kept verbatim over any generator.

A patch is two lists of world-space triangles.  `frozen` are the triangles the
human left, shipped exactly; `voids` are the generated triangles they replaced
or deleted.  Together they are the REGION the human took over: after the
generator runs, every generated triangle overlapping that region on its own
storey is removed, the frozen triangles go in, and whatever part of a removed
triangle lies outside the region is refilled on that triangle's own plane.

When the generator has not moved, the removed triangles are exactly the voids,
nothing needs refilling, and the result is the human's mesh.
