"""AI package wiring for converted actors.

TES4 PACK records are now really converted (see pack_converter.py), so an actor
keeps its OWN packages: the PKID list is the TES4 AIPackage list, in TES4 order,
because Skyrim — like Oblivion — runs the first package whose conditions pass.
Order is behaviour, not decoration.

Two things still come from vanilla:

* DPLT — the default package LIST every vanilla actor carries underneath its
  own packages (the fallback that keeps an actor doing *something* when none of
  its own packages apply).
* Creatures — their own packages come first, like an NPC's, then
  DefaultMasterPackageCreature, the one package every vanilla creature carries,
  for when none of their own apply.

Quest packages are NOT in the actor's PKID list: they hang off a QUST reference
alias (ALPC), which is how they outrank the standing schedule.  See pack_aliases.
